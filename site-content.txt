What is a chimera?

A chimera is a hybrid creature made up of the body parts of different animals.

The term originates in ancient Greek mythology. The Chimera was a fire-breathing monster with a lion's head, a goat's body, and a serpent's tail. 

Today, the word chimera casually refers to any implausible or fantasy hybrid animal. Mythical chimeras appear in numerous human cultures throughout the ages. Some popular chimeras include gargoyles, griffins, centaurs, harpies, and mermaids.

In science, chimera is used to describe a human engineered hybrid organism, or the result of a genetic anomaly.

Depending on the culture, chimeras can represent different mystical forces, from benevolent protector to devouring monster. The name-sake Greek Chimera was of the latter category.

Chimeras from a variety of cultures figure heavily in Western literature and art. Most westerners are familiar the following: gargoyle, griffin, centaur, sphynx, pegasus, and mermaid.

Some Asian examples include the Japanese Ushi-Oni, an ox-demon with a crablike body and tusks; the half bird Kinnari from South and Southeast Asia; and the Hindu man-lion called Narasimha.

In the realm of science, the term chimera has been adopted to describe an organism that contains at least two different sets of origin genetic material. 

Human chimeras
It is extrememly rare, but there are some humans whose bodies contain different sets of DNA. This is most often caused by the fusion of two or more genetically-distinct zygotes (fertilized) eggs into one during gestation.

Human-animal chimeras
Scientists hoping to test new medicines or grow human transplant organs in the lab have successfully created humanized mice, rats, pigs, and monkeys. There are strict ethical rules governing this research however, including gestational limits on embryos.

Chimeric viruses
Using genone editing, scientists researching techniques for the putative preventation and treatment of diseases are able to create chimeric viruses in the laboratory. Perhaps the most well known example of a chimeric virus is SARS-CoV-2, which is the cause Covid-19.
