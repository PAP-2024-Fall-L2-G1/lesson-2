        <h1>Mythical Chimeras</h1>
        <p>Depending on the culture, chimeras can represent different mystical forces, from benevolent protector to devouring monster. The name-sake <a href="https://mythologysource.com/chimera-greek-monster/">Greek Chimera</a> was of the latter category.</p>

        <p>Chimeras from a variety of cultures figure heavily in Western literature and art. Most westerners are familiar the following: gargoyle, griffin, centaur, sphynx, pegasus, and mermaid.</p>
            
        <p>Some Asian examples include the Japanese Ushi-Oni, an ox-demon with a crablike body and tusks; the half bird Kinnari from South and Southeast Asia; and the Hindu man-lion called Narasimha.</p>
